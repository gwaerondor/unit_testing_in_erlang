# Basic Erlang part 4 - eunit and meck
This is the fourth part of the basic Erlang series.

We will look more at the functionality provided by eunit:
- Test modules and test functions (recap)
- Fixtures
- Macros

We will also look at [meck, a mocking library for Erlang](https://github.com/eproxus/meck).

##Build and test
```bash
rebar3 eunit
```
